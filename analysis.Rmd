In the end, I decided to continue exploring some trends in *activity*, but this time more on the clinician side. 

```{r}
each_clincian <- clinic_lifetime %>% 
  group_by(hashed_clincian_id) %>% 
  count()

stat_clinician <- clinic_lifetime %>% 
  inner_join(each_clincian, by = "hashed_clincian_id") %>% 
  group_by(hashed_clincian_id) %>% 
  summarise(total_visits = sum(num_ginger_visits),
            mean_visits = mean(num_ginger_visits),
            max_weeks = max(cum_weeks),
            average_treatment_time = mean(cum_weeks),
            psych_count = sum(provider_type == "psych"),
            thera_count = sum(provider_type == "thera")) %>% 
  mutate(psych_cent = psych_count - mean(psych_count),
         thera_cent = thera_count - mean(thera_count),
         visits_cent = mean_visits - mean(mean_visits)) %>% 
  mutate(psych_prop = psych_count / total_visits)
stat_clinician

ggplot(stat_clinician, aes(x = total_visits, y = average_treatment_time)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = psych_prop)) +
  scale_fill_gradient(low = "red", high = "yellow")

model <- lm(data = stat_clinician, average_treatment_time ~ psych_cent + thera_cent)
tidy(model)
```


```{r}
clinic_coach <- clinic_lifetime %>% 
  inner_join(lifetime, by = c("hashed_member_id", "week_of_service")) %>% 
  rename(week_joined_clinic = week_joined.x,
         cum_weeks_clinic = cum_weeks.x,
         week_joined_coach = week_joined.y,
         cum_weeks_coach = cum_weeks.y) %>% 
  select(-X1.x, -X1.y) %>% 
  mutate(which_first = case_when(week_joined_coach > week_joined_clinic ~ "coach",
                                 week_joined_coach < week_joined_clinic ~ "clinic",
                                 week_joined_coach == week_joined_clinic ~ "same"))
clinic_coach

clinic_coach %>% 
  group_by(which_first) %>% 
  filter(which_first != "same") %>% 
  summarise(mean_msg = mean(num_msg),
            mean_visits = mean(num_ginger_visits)) %>% 
  mutate(msg_per_visit = mean_msg / mean_visits)

clinic_coach %>% 
  group_by(which_first, provider_type) %>% 
  filter(which_first != "same") %>% 
  summarise(mean_msg = mean(num_msg),
            mean_visits = mean(num_ginger_visits)) %>% 
  mutate(msg_per_visit = mean_msg / mean_visits)
```
Switch from thera to psych, what time

```{r}
clinic_coach %>% 
  filter(which_first == "coach")
```
