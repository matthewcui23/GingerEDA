## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
coach <- read_csv("coach_data.csv") %>% 
  rename(num_msg = `Number of messages per week`)

clinic <- read_csv("clinical_data.csv")
```

```{r}

  mutate(total_msg = sum(n * num_msg)) %>% 
  distinct(total_msg)
